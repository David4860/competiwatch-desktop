              No. You have to manually enter data after your games in order to see
              trends and other data about your competitive season. You might be interested

            <dd className="mb-4">
              <p>When logging placement matches, the result of the match
              (win/loss/draw) is required. For regular matches, only your new SR is required.</p>
              All other fields, like the map, heroes you played, and people you grouped
              with, are optional. However, if you don't fill in a field, you won't see trends
              about it. For example, if you never log the map you played on, you won't see a
              chart of win percentage by map.

            <dt className="mb-1 text-bold">Where do I get CSV files to import match data?</dt>
              <dd className="mb-4">
                If you've been logging your competitive matches in a spreadsheet with a tool
                like Excel or Google Sheets, you can produce a CSV (comma-separated value) file
                of the data you've already logged. Then you can import this CSV file into
                Competiwatch so you don't have to manually re-enter all those matches.
