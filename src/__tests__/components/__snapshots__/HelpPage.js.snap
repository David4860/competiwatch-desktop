          No. You have to manually enter data after your games in order to see trends and other data about your competitive season. You might be interested in

          <p>
            When logging placement matches, the result of the match (win/loss/draw) is required. For regular matches, only your new SR is required.
          </p>
          All other fields, like the map, heroes you played, and people you grouped with, are optional. However, if you don't fill in a field, you won't see trends about it. For example, if you never log the map you played on, you won't see a chart of win percentage by map.

          Where do I get CSV files to import match data?
        </dt>
        <dd
          className="mb-4"
        >
          If you've been logging your competitive matches in a spreadsheet with a tool like Excel or Google Sheets, you can produce a CSV (comma-separated value) file of the data you've already logged. Then you can import this CSV file into Competiwatch so you don't have to manually re-enter all those matches.
